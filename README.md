# Odin-Admin-Dashboard

## The last project in the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.

## After finishing the project I will have demonstrated my mastery of Grid and/or Flexbox.

## In finishing the project, I learned:

* That grid is better used laying out the entire page, while flex is better used when styling cards, boxes, and any smaller sections within the page.

* Grid is kinda like flexbox in terms of alignment and placement of items (most properties are comprehensible if you think about it just like flexbox). ie. if you know flex, then you can easily ask the question: "How would I do this in flexbox?."

* I've understand grid placement.

* I didn't want to spend too much time on the project, since I find it less important than JS. That's why I used a lot of hover effects instead of the semantics, like ```<a>```, I also didn't bother with the color theme. All I wanted to practice is the <strong>CSS GRID</strong>, then move forward to the JS courses.
